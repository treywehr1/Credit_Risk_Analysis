# Credit Risk Analysis

## Overview of Analysis
A number of supervised machine learning models and methods were used to develop a process of evaluating credit worthiness and the important features available when assessing credit worthiness.

RandomOverSampler, SMOTE, SMOTEENN algorithms, BalancedRandomForests and EasyEnsembleClassifier classifiers were used to evaluate predicted results and their effectiveness.


## Results
 - The results of the RandomOverSampler algorithm resulted in a balanced accuracy score of 0.6146309649640125. 
 - The avg/total accuracy of the ROS was .99 and the avg/total precision was measured at .67.
